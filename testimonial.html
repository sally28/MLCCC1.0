      <blockquote>"We love MLCCC! My kids not only improved their Chinese, but also enjoyed all kinds of cultural activities held at MLCCC. The teachers are great, very loving and encouraging, and very responsible. Special events such as the Mid-Autumn Concert, Chinese New Year Gala and School-Year Assembly are always our family's favorite times. We have been so happy that we found MLCCC as our kids' weekend Chinese school for the past two years."</blockquote>

      <blockquote>"We changed to the weekend school from another school-based program in the area. MLCCC staff were so welcoming and helped us find the right level for him. He fit right in. The teacher was excellent! The class was well structured around the lessons in the book with the right balance on the didactics and the speaking/practical part. The teacher did a great job managing the classroom and drew appropriate participation from several energetic boys and very quiet girls. My son loves Chinese and thrived at the school. We are not native speakers but he was able to make and sustain his progress. We are looking forward to the fall semester!"</blockquote>
