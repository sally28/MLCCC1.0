Teachers are native Mandarin speakers and the curriculum is designed to broaden the children's understanding and appreciation of Chinese language, culture, history, arts and customs in an engaging and effective way. This is a great opportunity for your child to explore other areas of interest beyond his or her normal schooling with a global perspective.</p>
    <p>We provide many fun activities including culture lessons, songs, dance, drawing, crafts, games, karate, and outdoors fun, all set within a Mandarin language learning environment. The camps offer the flexibility of registering for multi-week sessions or individual weeks, as well as full days or partial days. At the end of each multi-week session, campers will have an opportunity to present what they have learned to their parents by being in a camp-wide show.</p>
    <p>Our English Writing Summer Camp is open to all students entering 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th grade in September. It is taught by a Pennsylvania certified K-12 Language Arts teacher. The purpose is to improve writing skills, hone thinking abilities, and foster a confidence and fondness for words and language. Topics will include:</p>
    <ul  style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>various forms of writing such as narrative, persuasive, poetic, etc.</li>
        <li>literary language such as similes, metaphors, etc.</li>
        <li>writing techniques and organization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our Math Enrichment Summer Camp is open to all students entering 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th grade in September, and run in a similar manner as the Writing Camp. Our English Writing Camp,  Math Enrichment Camp, and Fencing Camp are within the same building as our Chinese Language and Culture Camp at Wayne, and are 3 hours a day for 2 weeks. Hence students at our Wayne location have the option to register for:</p>
