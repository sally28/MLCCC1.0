    <p>We provide many fun activities including culture lessons, songs, dance, drawing, crafts, games, karate, and outdoors fun, all set within a Mandarin language learning environment. The camps offer the flexibility of registering for multi-week sessions or individual weeks, as well as full days or partial days.
