     <p>MLCCC First Grade Chinese Language Teacher. A graduate from Henan Medical University, I have been working at the University of Pennsylvania as a cancer researcher for the last 25 years.
    This year will be my thirteenth year teaching at MLCCC’s Weekend School. Before teaching, I was, like many parents, an enthusiastic volunteer at our school and frequently served as a homeroom parent. During my college years, I had received professional training in Mandarin pronunciation and served as a campus radio broadcaster. That experience has been quite rewarding and ignited my love for our language and culture, and eventually facilitated my teaching career when I was called on to sub a class. It has been my love for teaching at MLCCC ever since.</p>
     <p>My teaching focuses on the fun part of learning because children learn best when they are having “a fun time”. Audio/video/slideshow presentations are integrated parts of my teaching in every class. It is to help children develop their perception and cognition of Chinese language and culture and lay the foundation for future learning. At the same time, I also advocate and encourage parents to participate in my teaching, maintain clear communication. My goal is to keep every child in learning. </p>
